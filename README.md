# Thing counter

Based off the Twitter thing where [people do things 100 times](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1330985556872818689),
especially new things, to go from "new big scary" to something routine.

## Notes

The thing has to be chosen carefully: it has to align with something I actually want, not just a secondary goal. Of
course, nothing is perfect, so secondary parts will always possibly take over. Stopping when it turns out that I
misjudged what I want is always an option: the primary objective is to fuck around and **stick it out long enough** to
find out.

Doesn't have to be good â€“ making crappy things with enough variation (and reflection, duh) is [a good way to get
good](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1467439390943186945).
